# CSE341 UserAPI Project

This project, developed for the **CSE341** course at Brigham Young University - Idaho, provides a **UserAPI** with basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality. The API is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** to manage user data efficiently, with **Swagger** documentation for easy API testing and exploration.

## Project Overview

The **UserAPI** allows clients to perform essential CRUD operations on user data, making it a robust and versatile backend solution for user management tasks.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: Full CRUD functionality to manage user profiles.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Comprehensive and interactive API documentation.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Persistent and reliable data storage using MongoDB.
- **Mongoose ODM**: Schema-based solution to model application data.
- **Express Framework**: Handles API routing and middleware effectively.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment for backend logic.
- **Express** - Web application framework for managing routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for reliable data storage.
- **Mongoose** - ODM library for MongoDB, providing schema validation.
- **Swagger** - Documentation tool to streamline API testing and exploration.

## API Documentation

Access the live Swagger documentation here: [https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/api-docs](https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/api-docs).

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the Documentation**: Use the Swagger link above to view available endpoints.
2. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data directly from the Swagger UI.

## About the Developer

This project was created by **Kolawole Jegede** as part of the CSE341 coursework, highlighting skills in API development, MongoDB data management, and interactive documentation with Swagger.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to **Brigham Young University - Idaho** and the **CSE341 course** for providing the foundation to develop this practical backend project.
